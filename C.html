            <p>In CS50's Lesson 2, we focused on learning the C programming language. This lesson introduced us to key aspects of programming, such as memory management and control over system resources. Understanding C was crucial because it required a grasp of low-level operations which are essential for developing efficient code.</p>

            <p>Among the assignments, the "Cash" program stood out. This program involved writing code to solve the coin change problem, a common problem in computer science. The task was to calculate the minimum number of coins required for change, introducing us to loops, arithmetic operations, and conditions in C. The Cash program was memorable for its practical application. It presented a real-world problem, which made it engaging and demonstrated the direct application of what we were learning. It also developed our problem-solving skills, as it required algorithmic thinking to find an efficient solution.</p>

            <p>This program helped reinforce our understanding of basic concepts in C, such as loops and conditionals. Completing the program gave a sense of achievement and laid the groundwork for understanding more complex algorithms and programming constructs.</p>
