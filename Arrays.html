            <p>In my CS50 experience, the lesson on arrays was particularly impactful. It provided crucial insights into data organization and manipulation in C. Understanding arrays, structured as contiguous memory blocks, was key for grasping memory management and efficient data processing. Working with arrays involved dealing with elements in consecutive memory slots, teaching me about indexing for quick data access. I learned about declaring arrays, iterating over them, and the intricate relationship between arrays and pointers in C. The course's exploration of multidimensional arrays furthered my ability to manage complex data structures.</p>

            <p>While the array-centric projects were technically challenging and vital for my foundational understanding, I found myself particularly drawn to the Readability program. This project, although not directly related to arrays, stood out in the curriculum. It involved algorithmic thinking and practical problem-solving but in a different context than the structured manipulations required for arrays.</p>

            <p>What made Readability my favorite was its approach to determining the reading level of a text. It used the Coleman-Liau index, a formula that estimates the U.S. grade level needed to comprehend a piece of writing. By counting the number of letters, words, and sentences in a text,
